<h1>Cretaceous Period</h1>

<p>During the Cretaceous Period, the most fearsome predator roamed North America. Tyrannosaurus Rex is the king of all 
dinosaurs. This dinosaur lived in North America among species such as Ankylosaurus, Edmontosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus
and Triceratops. Some scientists believe that this creature was an apex predator while others believed it to be a scavenger.
Regardless of which hypothesis you choose to believe, Tyrannosaurus Rex is truly one of the greatest finds in the history
of paleontology.</p>

<p>For a while, Tyrannosaurus Rex was thought to be the biggest and most deadliest of predatory dinosaurs, but as the years 
went on, paleontologists discovered much bigger specimens. This is one of them; Spinosaurs. This creature was bigger than
T-Rex, Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus put together. The most distinctive feature on this creature was its sail.
Spinosaurus is believed to have used the sail to intimidate other dinosaurs or possibly to attract a mate. If you were
ever to encounter this dinosaur, you better run for it!</p>

<p>As part of a family of dinosaurs called ceratopsians, Triceratops is considered one of the most famous dinosaurs ever 
discovered. It is one of the most common dinosaur fossils found. As a dinosaur that traveled in herds, large groups were common
in the North American plains where they would feed on tough low-growing plants. Triceratops would often clash with
Tyrannosaurus as many fossils have been found with bite marks clearly made in battle, Triceratops would even leave marks
on the Tyrannosaurus with its horns. Since this dinosaur is famous among many people, it pretty much speaks for itself.</p>

<p>In Jurassic Park, the velociraptor was believed to be as tall as a human. In reality, velociraptor was half the size of 
a human. Velociraptor lived in the desert of Mongolia and hunted in packs using its claws on its hands and feet. The claws
would cause deep wounds in the flesh of potential prey that would cause the prey to suffocate or bleed to death.
Velociraptor belonged to family of dinosaur genus called dromaeosaurid and if you were to go to a museum, you would see
various skeletons of this creature and its relatives.</p>

<p>The Cretaceous seas had many dangerous predators ranging from sharks to plesiosaurs. However, the largest of the killers 
during this time period were the mosasaurs. During the Cretaceous period, much of North America was an inland sea and the
mosasaurs would hunt prey such as sharks, seabirds, large fish and plesiosaurs. Mosasaurs are related to snakes. While
there were other aquatic sea monsters during the Mesozoic era, only a few can compare to the terror that the Mosasaurs
brought with them.</p>
