<p>There were many huge creatures that roamed the Jurassic Period. However, there are none that can compare to the famous 
Brachiosaurus. For a century, Brachiosaurus was considered to be the tallest of all dinosaurs until species such as 
Argentinosaurus were discovered. Fossils of this creature have been found in North America and Africa with the first 
skeleton found in Colorado in the year 1900. A truly magnificent species, Brachiosaurus is something to behold.</p>

<p>If you're familar with Jurassic predators, then you'll recognize the Ceratosaurus. A unique predator for its time, 
it had a horn that was either used for display, as a weapon, or possibly to attract mates. Living in the same time as the 
larger Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus was probably a scavenger and may have hunted aquatic life forms. A well-known creature in 
its own right, Ceratosaurs stands out as a truly magnificent specimen.</p>

<p>With plates on its back and a spiked tail, Stegosaurus was a sight to behold! When provoked, Stegosaurus would flush 
blood into its plates to give predators a warning; leave or face a devastating blow. It is the largest member of the 
stegosaur family and roamed the plains of North America. Stegosaurus had a small brain which was about the size of a kitten. 
This dinosaur lived in herds that moved through forests as they ate the low-growing plants. Stegosaurus had enemies such as 
Ceratosaurus and Allosaurus and would often clash with them in battle. If you've ever been to a museum, then you have 
encountered this amazing specimen.</p>

<p>Prior to the Cretaceous period, flying pterosaurs were beginning to become more widespread in the Jurassic Period. 
Dimorphodon was one of them. Although not nearly as impressive as Pteranodon or even Quetzalcoatlus, this pterosaur had
a distinct feature which was that it had two types of teeth. It has been speculated if this creature ate fish or insects.</p>
